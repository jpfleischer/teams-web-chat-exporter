Notes for exporters
- Teams can jump to very old history if the scrollbar is dragged to the very top; use incremental upward scrolling to capture mid‑old messages reliably.
- There appears to be a UI cap (~750 messages) after which Teams stops rendering older history in the browser; consider multi‑pass capture with a refresh and dedupe if coverage is missing.
